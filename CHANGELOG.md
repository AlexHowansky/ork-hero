## [unreleased]

### Changed

### Changed

- Background fields are now separated into discrete blocks.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-03-14

### Added

- Hit Locations block.

### Changed

- Switched from expecting JSON metadata to expecting raw CSS because that just makes way more sense. This allows far more customization to the resulting output and is significantly clearer for designers.
